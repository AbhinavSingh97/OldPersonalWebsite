      Maple Silver
      </p>
      	<p class="w3-text-grey w3-medium">
      	This is a private maplestory server designed to bring back the nostalgic feel the game had around 2007. Furthermore, along with bringing back old
      	elements it mixes in some good aspects from modern version. Currently rated as one of the top servers on gtop100.com, MapleSilver is something
      	fresh. The game aspects and client were designed in Java and the website, maplesilver.net, was made with elements from HTML/CSS and Javascript.		
        </p><br>
      <p class="w3-text-black w3-xlarge">
      Webserver
      </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey w3-medium">
        Basic webserver to process requests such as GET,HEAD, and offers cgi-like support to run any programs avaliable in the cgi-like directory. This program is made entirely in C with uses of concepts such as: socket programming, piping, signals, and handling multiple requests. The server is currently hosted, when running, on a port at my school server.

      <p class="w3-text-black w3-xlarge">
      Weatherly
      </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey w3-medium">
        An android application developed following a guide on Udacity to have a clean UI and provide weather data. The application has a nice interace using Android API's and some elements of XML for design. Fuctionality of the program comes mainly in the form of Java, while data is being grabbed using SQL.

      <p class="w3-text-black w3-xlarge">
      Animal Guessing Game
      </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey w3-medium">
        A C program to guess that animal you're thinking about by asking you a series of questions that will be stored in a database file. At first there will not be many questions if you're starting fresh, but will grow as you continue to play. This in sense will make the game smarter each time it is played and expand the database.

      <p class="w3-text-black w3-xlarge">
      Online Terminal Website
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey w3-medium">
       This project is essentially a unix based terminal that is online, built using javascript, html, and css with the help of the termlib js library. The terminal will serve as a new form of a personal website
        that allows any vistor to control a terminal to view all relevant information about the creator of the site.For the most part, the project is operational and does display my relevant information. However,
        I am still working on it to improve some design elements and functionality of the program.
        Check it out here: https://abhinavsingh97.github.io/Online-Terminal-Website/

      Retro
      </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey w3-medium">
        A text editor built using Java Swing that offers some basic functionality that most text editors would. A much more minimilsatic text editor resembling something close to nano. 
        </p><br>
     <p class="w3-text-black w3-xlarge">
      Ray Caster
      </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey w3-medium">
       One of my first coding projects done in Python and serves as a ray caster that can project images based on an input file. Essentially forms the basis for what could be a very simple game engine, but not one that you would prefer due to its long itme to render an image.
        </p><br>
      <p class="w3-text-black w3-xlarge">
      Pixel Image Converter
      </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey w3-medium">
       Will allow an image to be blurred or shaded by altering each pixel based off certain math calculations. Can also be used to decode an image with minor altercations and an understanding of how each pixels color was determined. Meaning each pixel is altered by some math value and the program will just reverse that process for each of the pixels. Done entirely in Python.

      Chat Bot
      </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey w3-medium">
          A chat bot that will continually learn the more it used, currently still learning about how a chat bot will work in terms of fucntions and will begin to implement once I get a solid understanding of what
          I will be doing.
